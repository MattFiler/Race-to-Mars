	*  @brief the input handler system.
	*  
	*  The input class is designed to work alongside the 
	*  renderer and is responsible for sending events 
	*  to interested parties. It will also provide helper 
	*  functions that can retrieve non-event driven data
	*  such as the cursor position or the gamepad status. 
	*  Much of the underlying implementation will be platform
	*  specific, with input offering a compatible interface.
