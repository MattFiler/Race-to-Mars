	*  system. Input is often intrinsically linked to the render
	*  subsystem. To help speed up development, a typical update
	*  and render function is provided, along with GameTime. The
	*  initilisation code is not created by the Game, but by its
	*  dervied classes as the setup of the renderer is platform
	*  specific.
