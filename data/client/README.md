# Game Data
Store all the resources you intend to use in your game here. It's recommended that you use a sensible structure i.e.

- -> Audio
- -> Backgrounds
- -> Textures
- -> Textures/Aliens
- -> Textures/Player
- -> SpriteSheets

The build target +GameData will package all files here for in use in your ASGE game, ready for use via the virtual FileIO system.
